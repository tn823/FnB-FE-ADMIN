# F&B Front-End Project

[TODO] Description for f&b 

## üßë‚Äçüíª Get Started

You will be invited to the project first. Then, you have to setup ssh for this project

Prerequisites:

- Node 20+ (prefer way: setup nvm, then run command `nvm install 20` -> `nvm use 20`)
- Yarn 1.22+
- Setup ssh 
- VSCode
- Installing [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [Eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extentions

To set up the app, please execute the following commands.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fandboder/React-FE-web.git
cd fe-web
yarn install
```

The common commands:

`yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

`yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the production mode.\
Require `yarn build` before

`yarn push` 

Deploy staging (make sure you have aws credential before running this command).

## üóÑ Project Structure

The code in the root folder looks like this:

```sh
src
|
+-- .husky            # You can catch hooks when you commit or push, see more at https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/
|
+-- .next             # build folder of NextJS, see more at https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying
|
+-- .vscode           # vscode editor configuration
|
+-- public            # folder contains static file which is not used by your app when it compiles
|
+-- src               # main source code

```

Most of the code lives in the `src` folder should be common and looks like this:

```sh
src
+-- app               # app routes defined by Nextjs
|
+-- assets            # shared assets (images, icons)
|
+-- components        # shared, pure components used across the entire application (define component props types into file)
|
+-- constants         # shared constants used across the entire application
|
+-- hooks             # shared hooks used across the entire application
|
+-- lib               # re-exporting different libraries preconfigured for the application
|
+-- services          # API services (Client <-> service <-> Server)
|
+-- stores            # global state stores with Redux
|
+-- types             # base, common types used across the application
|
+-- utils             # shared utility functions
```

Most of the code lives in the `src/components` folder and looks like this:

```sh
components            # all components might be reused
|
+-- core              # all pure components which is not related to business logic, it can be used anywhere
|
+-- layouts           # all layout components
|
+-- features          # all features components which is related to business logic
```

Most of the code lives in the `src/app` folder defined by [app routing convention](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/project-structure#app-routing-conventions). This is our own complementary convention:

```sh
Note: The following files are optional, related only to the business logic of that route or its children, and should be used by sibling or child routes.
app
+-- _components       # all components
|
+-- constants.tsx     # all constants
|
+-- types.tsx         # all types
|
+-- utils.tsx         # all utils
```

## üìÅ Folder and file naming convention
Components are using `Camel Case`. The others are using `kebab-case`

## üå≥ Git branch naming convention

Feature: Create a new branch from the `develop` branch, branch name follows this pattern `feature/TaskNo_TaskName`.
Ex: `feature/PRO-10_Login`

Bug: Should confirm where should branch checkout from. Branch name follows pattern `fix/TaskNo_TaskName`.
Ex: `fix/PRO-10_Login`

Production bug: Should confirm where should branch checkout from. Branch name follows patterns `hotfix/TaskNo_TaskName`.
Ex: `hotfix/PRO-10_Login`
